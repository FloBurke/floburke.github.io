    <h1>New term starts Monday 4th September - new members welcome!</h1>
    <h2><b>Welcome to the Oundle and District Choral Society</b></h2>
    <p>We are a mixed voice choir who have been in existence for over 100 years. We draw our membership from a 
        fairly wide rural area and currently have approximately seventy voices who meet for rehearsals <b>every Monday during term time.</b></p>
    <p>Although we are an independent choral society, we have close links with Oundle School with whom we often 
        perform and who regularly support our concerts. <b>Our rehearsals are held in Laxton Junior School Hall, East Road, Oundle, PE8 4BX, from 7.30pm until 9.30pm.</b></p>
    <p>There is no requirement to audition and all singers are made welcome no matter what skill level you have. 
        We are grateful to Oundle Town Council for their continuing financial support but, much like most societies, 
        we are a registered charity and are obliged to charge a subscription fee. However, don't let that stop you from coming along to see if you like us!</p>
    <p>If you are interested in joining our society please contact us for more information by telephoning/emailing using the details below.</p>
    <p>Registered charity number: 1098947</p>
